# (PHYS08026) Computer Simulation

Code for the Computer Simulation course at the University of Edinburgh. Extras are included.

I plan to eventually develop a website for this repository using the django framework. Furthermore the ideas from the individual checkpoints will be spinned off into bigger projects.

### Checkpoints

1. Polynomial Class

2. Radioactive Decay

3. Fractals

4. Traffic Simulation

5. Orbital Motion
